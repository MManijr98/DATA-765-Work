    "    \n",
    "1. debug the programs step by step like what we did in class, including but not limited to: carefully designing test cases, reading and understanding error messages (if any), making copies of the code, debugging with print statement or exception handling, making modifications, and finally present the correct solution that can pass all of the test cases. Note that you may need to go back and forth between different steps to test and debug the code.\n",

Note that the description should include: how many and what are the bugs in the program (obvious v.s. hidden; persistent v.s. occasional)? How did you find them? How did you solve the problems? And why did you use the specific test cases (i.e. explain the logic of designing the test cases)?\n",
